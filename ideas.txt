Each agent can be built using LangChain and can include:
- Basic memory system
- Simple tool integrations
- Error handling
- User interaction interface
- Basic logging

Advanced Implementation Features:
- Agent orchestration
- Robust error recovery
- Performance monitoring
- Security implementation
- API integration patterns

Recommended Implementation Order:
1. Start with Conversational Assistant
2. Move to Math Problem Solver
3. Progress to Document Q&A
4. Then explore others based on interest

Note: Each agent should first be implemented with basic functionality, 
then gradually enhanced with more features and capabilities.

Note: Consider implementing these with modern frameworks like LangChain,
AutoGen, or CrewAI for enhanced capabilities.
