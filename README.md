# Agent-Foundry

Welcome to **Agent-Foundry**, a repository dedicated to building and experimenting with multiple simple LLM-based agents using [langgraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). This project is a hands-on journey into understanding and creating AI agents while exploring the powerful capabilities of langgraph for building complex agent workflows.

## 🛠 Features

1. **Simple LLM Agents**: Start with basic agents to understand their core logic.
2. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Experiment with complex agent workflows and interactions.
3. **Custom Tool Integrations**: Add tools like calculators, web search, or APIs to enhance agent capabilities.
