# Agent-Foundry

Welcome to **Agent-Foundry**, a repository dedicated to building and experimenting with multiple simple LLM-based agents using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com). This project is a hands-on journey into understanding and creating AI agents while exploring the versatility of LangChain.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build and experiment with various LLM agents.
- Learn the foundational concepts of AI agents.
- Explore different use cases and functionalities enabled by LangChain.
- Develop a modular and reusable framework for AI agent experimentation.

---

## 🛠 Features

1. **Simple LLM Agents**: Start with basic agents to understand their core logic.
2. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Experiment with interactions between multiple agents.
3. **Custom Tool Integrations**: Add tools like calculators, web search, or APIs to enhance agent capabilities.
4. **Agent Behavior Customization**: Explore different agent types, such as conversational, action-oriented, or retrieval-augmented agents.
