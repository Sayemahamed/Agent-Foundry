## üõ† Features

1. **Simple LLM Agents**: Core logic understanding.
2. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Complex workflows and interactions.
3. **Custom Tool Integrations**: Extend capabilities with APIs, web search, and utilities.

## üìä Graph Implementations

- **BasicGraph**: `./01/graph.py`
- **Graph with customReducer**: `./02/graph.py`
- **Calculator_agent**: `./03/graph.py`
- **Summary_keeping_agent**: `./04/graph.py`
- **More planned implementations**

## üîß Future Agent Ideas

- **Conversational Assistant**: Context-aware chat with personality customization.
- **Math Solver**: Step-by-step problem solving with calculator integration.
- **File Management Agent**: Organizes, renames, and moves files.
- **Weather Agent**: Retrieves and summarizes weather forecasts.
- **Task Scheduler**: Manages calendar events and reminders.
- **News Summarizer**: Fetches, categorizes, and summarizes articles.
- **Document Q&A**: Parses and answers queries based on documents.
- **Translation Agent**: Multi-language support and text translation.
- **Code Helper**: Syntax checking, debugging, and explanations.
- **Research Assistant**: Web search, information extraction, and source verification.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Task distribution, agent interaction, and conflict resolution.
- **AI Image Analysis**: Object detection and image description generation.
- **Data Analysis Agent**: Statistical processing and visualization generation.
- **Smart Automation**: IoT integration and rule-based automation.
- **Content Creation**: SEO-optimized article structuring and topic research.

### Development Roadmap:
1. **Phase 1**: Build foundational agents with LangChain.
2. **Phase 2**: Integrate orchestration, API enhancements, and logging.
3. **Phase 3**: Explore frameworks like AutoGen, CrewAI for scalable solutions.
